### 🧮 Machine Learning Model (Day 7)

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict passenger survival.  
**Results:**

- Accuracy: 0.79
- ROC-AUC: 0.83
- Key predictors: Sex, Pclass, Fare, IsAlone

Visualized **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC Curve** to evaluate performance.  
Saved model summary in `data/titanic_model_summary.csv`.

- Added theoretical explanation of Logistic Regression.
- Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models.
- Implemented cross-validation for robust model evaluation.
- Expanded notebook with model interpretation Q&A section.
